# Step 3: Hint 2 — Sieve of Eratosthenes
# Answer:
# The sieve finds all prime numbers together. First, we consider the numbers as prime. Then we start from 2 and mark its multiples as not prime.
#  We repeat this for the next unmarked number. At the end, the numbers which are not marked are prime.

# 5. Compare all three times for N = 2,000,000 side by side.

# 6. Which single change gave the biggest jump in speed? Explain why. 
# 6. Which single change gave the biggest jump in speed?
# Answer:

# The Sieve of Eratosthenes gave the biggest improvement.

# The naive and smaller-bound methods test each number separately. 
# The sieve instead finds all prime numbers together and avoids repeatedly solving the same primality problem.
