#  7. What happened to the time when N grew by 10 times? Does this match what you would expect from a nested loop approach? 
# When N increased from 5,000 to 50,000, the execution time increased significantly. This is because the solution uses two nested loops, so the number of comparisons grows approximately as N^2.

# When N becomes 10 times larger, the amount of work becomes roughly:

#  10^2 = 100 

# times larger.

# Therefore, the large increase in execution time is expected for a nested-loop approach. This shows that the naive solution has O(N²) time complexity.
